## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Lessons

Lessons are defined in `src/data/curriculum.ts`. To add a new lesson:

```typescript
{
  id: 'course-lesson-id',
  title: 'Lesson Title',
  description: 'Brief lesson description',
  difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced',
  estimatedTime: 30, // minutes
  content: `# Lesson Content in Markdown`,
  codeExample: 'console.log("Hello, World!");',
  language: 'javascript',
  exercises: [
    {
      id: 'exercise-id',
      title: 'Exercise Title',
      description: 'Exercise instructions',
      starterCode: '// Your code here',
      solution: '// Solution code',
      hints: ['Helpful hint 1', 'Helpful hint 2']
    }
  ]
}
```

### Theming

The application supports custom themes through CSS variables in `App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #3b82f6;
  --background-color: #ffffff;
  --text-primary: #111827;
  /* ... more variables */
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
  --background-color: #0f172a;
  --text-primary: #f8fafc;
  /* ... dark theme overrides */
}
```
